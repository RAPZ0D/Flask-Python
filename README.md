# Flask-Python
Hey Everyone visiting this Repository. I am actually using python programming language and here I am utilizing the flask library to check how it works. 

-[Login Page](#login-page)

## Login Page
In this file I have created a simple login page. This Login page consists of: 
1. A starting login page which asks you for your email and password
2. A registeration page where you can go and reigster to make a new account
3. An Admin Page
4. After a successful login a Two factor authorization page where you will have to verify by inputting the code

So basically for this project I have used Flask library to improve my knowledge with this library, I have also used the Sqllite3 library to store the data of email and password in the database. For more information about the library, you can view it by clicking the link below.
